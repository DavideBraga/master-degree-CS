## Contents:
- In-depth lecture notes
- Code snippets and examples
- Supplementary resources

  *Note: The materials provided in this repository were created as part of the coursework for the Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering. All credits and rights to the educational content belong to the University of Verona. Some inspiration was taken from https://github.com/alessiogj, which covers similar courses. In particular, the cryptography notes are derived from that source. Additionally, the notes on Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Parallel Programming were created by https://github.com/nickkpiccoli . I have only partially modified the notes in question.*

Feel free to explore the content, contribute, or provide feedback. Let's collaboratively build a valuable resource for everyone in the computer science community. Happy coding and learning! üñ•Ô∏èüìö
