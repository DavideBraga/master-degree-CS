`rtal` is a very basic command but you better know the few options it offers you.

With:
```bash
rtal help
```

you get to know about its options and about its subcommands (including `help` itself). In turn, `help` can be used to ask for more specific information about the other subcommands.
For example:
```bash
rtal help get
```

It might reveal crucial that you know the options and arguments of subservice `connect`, which you use for submitting and receiving feedback. Therefore, do not forget to issue:
```bash
rtal help connect
```

The service list gives you the most information when you use it like this:
```bash
rtal list -v BFS
```

However, this information is still too poor for you to get to know all of the services which come with a TALight problem. It limits itself to synctactic data and the semantic is easily missed.

For this reason we strongly advice you to also read the much shorter but more informative `know_synopsis.typ` text file.
